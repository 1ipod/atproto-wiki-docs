# AT Protocol
The **AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol)**, also commonly abbreviated as **ATProto**, is an open communications protocol intended to be used for decentralized social networking services. The protocol is currently under development by [Bluesky Social](/Development/Bluesky_Social), a public benefit corporation originally created as an independent research group within Twitter in order to investigate the possibility of decentralizing the service. The AT Protocol was first announced on May 4th, 2022 under the name ADX (Authenticated Data Experiment), and became available for developers on June 20, 2023.
