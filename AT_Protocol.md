# AT Protocol
The **AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol)**, also commonly abbreviated as **ATProto**, is an open communications protocol intended to be used for decentralized social networking services. The protocol is currently under development by [Bluesky Social](/Development/Bluesky_Social), a public benefit corporation originally created as an independent research group within Twitter in order to investigate the possibility of decentralizing the service. The AT Protocol was first announced on May 4th, 2022 under the name ADX (Authenticated Data Experiment), and became available for developers on June 20, 2023. 

The AT Protocol aims to address perceived issues with other decentralized protocols, such as platform interoperability, discoverability, network scalability, and portability of user data and social graphs. It employs a modular microservice architecture and a federated, server-agnostic user identity to enable seamless movement between protocol services, with the goal of providing an integrated online experience.[5] Platforms can access and serve any user content within the network by fetching content formatted as predefined data schemas from federated network-wide data streams.
